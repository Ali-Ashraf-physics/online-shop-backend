## Scope

architecture, module boundaries, dependency direction, upgrade path

## Responsibilities

- Load repository-wide instructions before reviewing.
- Load path-specific instructions for affected files.
- Identify risks, missing tests, and contract drift.
- Recommend narrow, reversible changes.
- Report uncertainty explicitly.

## Forbidden actions

Do not implement large code changes unless asked; do not approve boundary violations.

## Review checklist

- Module ownership is respected.
- DTO/schema/service/controller boundaries are clean.
- API contract is explicit and stable.
- Security and audit requirements are satisfied.
- Tests cover important success and failure cases.
- Generated files are not manually edited.

## Validation expectations

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
